| Type of Award | Additional Considerations

| **Top Prizes (Top 3 teams of each category)** | The prize moneys for each category will be distributed equally among the registered members of the winning teams^. <br><br>For example, team XYZ consisting of 4 members, wins the top prize (SGD $15,000) for the open category. The prize sum of SGD $3,750 will be transferred to the bank account of each individual member. The bank account number is to be provided by each individual member. <br><br>The attribution and award of the Top Prizes will be at team level.
| **Coins of Honour (Top 10 teams of each category)** | The GovTech CSG C01N and certificate will be delivered via courier to a local representative of each of the winning teams. If a local representative is unavailable, alternative arrangements may be made with that team separately.
| **Mastery Awards (across all participation categories)** | The Mastery Awards will be in the form of a prize money that will be disbursed to a single bank account submitted by each of the winning teams. <br><br>The prerequisite of the awards will be detailed in [{{- site.url -}}2020/prizes](/2020/prizes). <br><br>The attribution and award of the Mastery Awards will be at the team level. There are multiple awards for the Mastery Awards, and each award will only have 1 winning team. The winner of each award will be the best performing team (across all 3 categories) that successfully meets the award's corresponding requirements.
| **Awesome Write-ups (across all participation categories)** | The Organising Committee will assess each competition entry based on the assessment rubrics detailed at [{{- site.url -}}2020/prizes](/2020/prizes). Upon successful completion of the competition, GovTech plans to release the competition code, write-ups and materials via a public GitHub repository (referred to as the **"Competition GitHub Repository"**), please see the **[General Terms and Conditions](/general-terms-and-conditions/) for the STACK the Flags Capture The Flag (CTF) event and competition** for details. The Competition GitHub Repository will contain the details of the competition, the CTF challenges and the competition write-ups that were nominated as the best write-ups by GovTech. The details and contents of the Competition GitHub Repository shall be in the sole discretion of GovTech. <br><br>The attribution and award of the Awesome Write-up will be at team level. Only the challenges detailed at [{{- site.url -}}2020/prizes](/2020/prizes) are eligible for the Awesome Write-up awards. The details of the eligible challenges will be made known at a later date. Each specific challenge will only have 1 winning entry.

Prizes may be subject to terms, restrictions and conditions imposed by GovTech.
